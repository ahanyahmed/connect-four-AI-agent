# connect-four-AI-agent
Connect four game using python GUI and using different types of minimax algorithms for AI agent

The project aims to revolutionize the gameplay experience of Connect 4 by integrating advanced artificial intelligence techniques, particularly the Minimax algorithm, to create an AI opponent capable of challenging human players with strategic decision-making. Starting with the development of the Connect 4 game environment, including the game board, player actions, win conditions, and user interface, the project progresses to the implementation of the Minimax algorithm. This algorithm enables the AI player to simulate future game states, systematically evaluating potential moves to minimize potential losses while maximizing potential gains. Additionally, heuristic evaluations are incorporated to enhance the AI player's decision-making process, considering factors such as the number of potential winning moves and the presence of blocking moves. To further optimize performance, alpha-beta pruning is employed, reducing computational overhead by discarding unpromising branches of the game tree. Through extensive testing and evaluation against human players and other AI opponents, the effectiveness of the implemented techniques is assessed, providing insights into the intersection of game theory and artificial intelligence in the context of Connect 4. Ultimately, the project delivers not only a refined gaming experience but also a deeper understanding of strategic decision-making in board games facilitated by modern AI techniques.
